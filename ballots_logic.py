"""Board email votes: who votes, how votes count, and when a vote is decided. Pure functions, so they are tested alone.

The rules come from the bylaws and the board's online-voting policy:
- Bylaws Art. IV s6.3: the board may vote by email; s6.5: every Director has one vote. The board has 13 seats: the four
  officers (RE, ARE, Secretary, Treasurer), four elected Directors at Large, and five appointed Directors (Road Racing,
  RallyCross, Road Rally, Solo/Autocross, Financial). A person holding two seats still votes once.
- Policy (2018), online votes: the answers are Yes, No and Abstain; 7 votes decide it (7 Yes passes, 7 No fails); a vote
  not decided within 30 days closes; a vote taken at a board meeting replaces the online vote; online results are noted
  in the next meeting's minutes.
